\section{INTRODUCTION}
How Are Databases Used In Social Media? They can exchange music, pictures, data and engage in online conversations or discussions. Just like any other website that accepts and produces data, a social media website has a database where this information is stored.

What databases does Instagram use? Instagram mainly uses two backend database systems: PostgreSQL and Cassandra. Both PostgreSQL and Cassandra have mature replication frameworks that work well as a globally consistent data store.

What is social database? SOCIALDATABASE is an Official Twitter Partner that has developed a software platform that enriches Twitter data. Our custom code is able to surface job roles, personal interests, behaviors and more. The SOCIALDATABASE platform has envisioned a whole new kind of audience: the SUPERAUDIENCE.

Retail stores can use databases to store prices, customer information, sales information and quantity on hand
\section{Which database does Netflix use?}
Netflix uses AWS for nearly all its computing and storage needs, including databases, analytics, recommendation engines, video transcoding, and more—hundreds of functions that in total use more than 100,000 server instances on AWS.
\section{What is the main use of database?}
Databases can store very large numbers of records efficiently (they take up little space). It is easy to add new data and to edit or delete old data. Data can be searched easily, eg ‘find all Ford cars’. Data can be sorted easily, for example into ‘date first registered’ order.
\section{What is importance of database?}
Databases are a collection of organized information that can easily be accessed, managed and updated. Database systems are very important to your business because they communicate information related to your sales transactions, product inventory, customer profiles and marketing activities.
\section{Is social media data private or public?}

\section{Is social media a database?}
Just like any other website that accepts and produces data, a social media website has a database where this information is stored. Read on to learn how the databases are applied in social media platforms.
\section{What is social data usage?}
Social data is information that social media users publicly share, which includes metadata such as the user’s location, language spoken, biographical data, and/or shared links.
\section{How do databases work?}
Database defined

Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled in rows and columns in a series of tables to make processing and data querying efficient. The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized.
\section{Which database does Apple use?}
CloudKit is Apple’s cloud database behind many of iCloud’s features including iOS backups, Photos, iWork sharing and iCloud Drive.
\section{Does Google use SQL?}
Cloud SQL is a fully-managed database service that helps you set up, maintain, manage, and administer your relational databases on Google Cloud Platform. You can use Cloud SQL with MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server. Not sure what database option is right for you? Learn more about our database services.
\section{Does Google use Oracle?}
Google’s parent company Alphabet is moving its internal financial operations from Oracle to SAP software. The news, first reported by CNBC, coincidentally comes on the same day the Supreme Court gave the final verdict in a decade-long legal battle between Oracle and Google (handing Google victory).
\section{Is Netflix SAAS or PaaS?}
Netflix built a custom Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) from scratch.
\section{Which database is used by Amazon?}
Amazon RDS is available on several database instance types – optimized for memory, performance or I/O – and provides you with six familiar database engines to choose from, including Amazon Aurora, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle Database, and SQL Server.
\section{Why does Netflix use a database?}
Netflix uses three NoSQL tools: SimpleDB, HBase and Cassandra. “The reason why we use multiple NoSQL solutions is because each one is best suited for a specific set of use cases,” Izrailevsky writes.
\section{What is DBMS in simple words?}
A Database Management System (DBMS) is software designed to store, retrieve, define, and manage data in a database.
\section{What is advantage and disadvantage of database?}
Increased costs:

Database systems require sophisticated hardware and software and highly skilled personnel. The cost of maintaining the hardware, software, and personnel required to operate and manage a database system can be substantial.
\section{What are two advantages of DBMS?}
A Database Management System (DBMS) is defined as the software system that allows users to define, create, maintain and control access to the database. DBMS makes it possible for end users to create, read, update and delete data in database. ꔷReduced data redundancy. ꔷReduced updating errors and increased consistency.
\section{What is the disadvantages of database?}
This is the first disadvantage of the database management system. This is because, for DBMS, it is mandatory to have a high-speed processor and also a large memory size. After all, nowadays there is a large amount of data in every field which needs to be store safely and with security.
